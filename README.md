## Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive job seeking web application using the MERN Stack, demonstrating proficiency in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Led the project from backend server setup to frontend interface design, addressing the needs of both job seekers and employers. This hands-on experience has equipped me with the skills to create professional-grade job portals.
